Title: Test 5 - Simple Test - Missing files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Test 10 requests coming in at different times to ensure the schedulers put 
them in the right order. A non existent file should not interfere with the
scheduling of the other requests.
This is a smaller test than Tests 6-9 so that we can easily confirm the order
by hand.

How it works: 
10 requests will come in at different times to be scheduled by the scheduler.
This is the same as the previous test, with the exception that one of the 
requests asks for a file that does not exist. There scheduling should be
the same as the previous test with the exception of the missing file.
