Title: Test 0 - Simultaneous requests, different files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Test 5 simultaneous requests accessing different files.
Each file has different lengths which will affect the scheduling order.

How it works: 
5 clients connect to the server at the same time. After a brief pause 
to ensure all are connected they will each request a different file at the 
same time.

Expected Results:
SJF: 
	They should go from shortest to longest, so : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
RR: 
	They should go based on who arrives first, but a long file will require 
	multiple passes. The order will be something like: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5...
	
MLFQ:
	They should go based on who arrives first, but a long file will require 
	multiple passes and be bumped to different priority queues.
	The order will be something like: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, ...
