Title: Test 0 - Simultaneous requests, different files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Test 5 simultaneous requests accessing different files.
Each file has different lengths which will affect the scheduling order.

How it works: 
5 clients connect to the server at the same time. After a brief pause 
to ensure all are connected they will each request a different file at the 
same time.

Expected Results:
SJF: 
	They should go from shortest to longest, so : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
RR: 
	They should go based on who arrives first, but a long file will require 
	multiple passes. Since they all arrive at the same time the order varies 
	slightly, but testtext3 and testtext4 are greater than 8kb
	so the order will be something like: 
	
MLFB:
	They should go based on who arrives first, but a long file will require 
	multiple passes and be bumped to different priority queues.
	Since they all arrive at the same time the order varies slightly, but 
	testtext3 is greater than 8kb and testtext4 is greater than 64 kb so the 
	order will be something like:
