Title: Test 1 - Simultaneous requests, same files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Test 5 simultaneous requests accessing the same file.
Since they're all accessing the same file, but only reading from it, there should not be
any conflict. The order will vary each time because the file size will be the same for each request
which means scheduling will depend on who managed to connect first.

How it works: 
5 clients connect to the server at the same time. After a brief pause 
to ensure all are connected they will each request the same file at the 
same time.

Expected Results:
SJF: 
	They are all the same size so the order will vary based on which request 
	manages to connect first.
	So any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 2, 4, 1, 5, 3 etc.
RR: 
	They are all the same size so the order will vary based on which request 
	manages to connect first.
	So any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 2, 4, 1, 5, 3 etc.
	Each request will only appear once since they are all less than 8kb.
	
MLFB:
	They are all the same size so the order will vary based on which request 
	manages to connect first.
	So any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 2, 4, 1, 5, 3 etc.
	Each request will be delivered in full and will never need to be bumped 
	to another queue because they are all less than 8kb.
