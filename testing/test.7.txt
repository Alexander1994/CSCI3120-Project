Title: Test 7 - Large Test - Clustered - Small files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Ensure that our server can handle up to the specified 100 requests, 
so 100 potential threads, of small files. 
Each of these files only requires one pass through the scheduler.
The requests will come in much more frequently than test 6 to ensure
that the server can handle many requests at a time.

How it works: 
100 requests will come in and they will have much smaller delays than 
Test 6. However, they will only request files that are under 8kb.
