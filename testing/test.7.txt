Title: Test 7 - Large Test - Clustered - Small files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Ensure that our server can handle a large number of requests for small files. 
Each of these files only requires one pass through the scheduler.
The requests will come in much more frequently than test 6 to ensure
that the server can handle many requests at a time.

How it works: 
39 requests will come in and they will have much smaller delays than 
Test 6.  They will also only request files that are under 8kb.
39 was the largest number of request we could do before the python
script started having problems.

Expected Results:
All results should be scheduled according to their algorithms.
The server should not crash.
