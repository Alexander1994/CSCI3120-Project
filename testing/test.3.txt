Title: Test 3 - Simple Test - Small Files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Test 10 requests coming in at different times to ensure the schedulers put 
them in the right order. All requests ask for valid files that are less than 8kb.
Each request should only require one pass through the scheduler.
This is a smaller test than Tests 6-9 so that we can easily confirm the order
by hand.

How it works: 
10 requests will come in at different times to be scheduled by the scheduler.
All requests will be fore files less than 8 kb

Expected Results:
All results should be scheduled according to their algorithms.
RR and MLFB will have similar results since each file only needs to pass through
the scheduler once.
SJF: 
	1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10  or 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 8, 7, 9, 10
	Since request 7 and 8 are the same length and arrive at the  same time their 
	order may vary based on who connects first.
	
RR: 
	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10 or a few other 
	combinations.
	Files 4, 5, and 6 and files 7, 8, and 9 have requests sent at the same time.
	Since they each only require one pass through the scheduler, ordering will 
	depend on who manage to connect first.
	
MLFB:
	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10 or a few other 
	combinations.
	Files 4, 5, and 6 and files 7, 8, and 9 have requests sent at the same time.
	Since they each only require one pass through the scheduler, ordering will 
	depend on who manage to connect first.
