Title: Test 3 - Simple Test - Small Files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Test 10 requests coming in at different times to ensure the schedulers put 
them in the right order. All requests ask for valid files that are less than 8kb.
Each request should only require one pass through the scheduler.
This is a smaller test than Tests 6-9 so that we can easily confirm the order
by hand.

How it works: 
10 requests will come in at different times to be scheduled by the scheduler.
All requests will be fore files less than 8 kb
Expected Results:
All results should be scheduled according to their algorithms.
RR and MLFQ will have similar results since each file only needs to pass through
the scheduler once.
