Title: Test 9 - Large test - Clustered - Large files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Similar to the past test. can handle a large number of requests for small and 
large files. Unlike Tests 6 and 7 with the small files, some of these 
requests will require multiple passes in the scheduler for Round Robin 
or MLFB.
The requests are also much less stagered than the previous test to 
ensure that the server can handle having many requests in its system
at once.

How it works: 
29 requests will come in for all file sizes and they will all come in
more frequently than Test 8.

Expected Results:
All results should be scheduled according to their algorithms.
The server should not crash.
SJF: 
	Something like
	1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 11, 14, 12, 13.....
	Since requests 1, 5 and 2, 4 and 6-9 etc. are the same length and 
	arrive at the  same time their order may vary based on who 
	connects first.
RR: 
	Something like
	1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 11, 14, 12, 13, 1, 7, 11, 1, 11, 1, ....
	Since requests 2, 4 and 6,9 etc. are the same length and 
	arrive at the  same time their order may vary based on who 
	connects first.	
	
MLFB:
	Something like
	1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 11, 14, 12, 13, 1, 7, 11, 1, 11, 1, ....
	Since requests and 2, 4 and 6, 9 etc. are the same length and 
	arrive at the  same time their order may vary based on who 
	connects first.
