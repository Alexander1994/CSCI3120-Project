Title: Test 9 - Large test - Clustered - Large files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Similar to the past test. Ensure that our server can handle up to 
the specified 100 requests, so 100 potential threads, of small and 
large files. Unlike Tests 6 and 7 with the small files, some of these 
requests will require multiple passes in the scheduler for Round Robin 
or MLFB.
The requests are also much less stagered than the previous test to 
ensure that the server can handle having many requests in its system
at once.

How it works: 
100 requests will come in for all file sizes and they will all come in
more frequently than Test 8.

Expected Results:
SJF: 
	
RR:
