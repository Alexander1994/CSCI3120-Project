Title: Test 6 - Large Test - Spread Out - Small Files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Ensure that our server can handle a large number of requests, for small files. 
Each of these files only requires one pass through the scheduler.

How it works: 
39 requests will come in and they will be spaced out over a fairly 
large amount of time. However, they will only request files that
are under 8kb.
39 was the largest number of request we could do before the python
script started having problems.

Expected Results:
All results should be scheduled according to their algorithms.
The server should not crash.
