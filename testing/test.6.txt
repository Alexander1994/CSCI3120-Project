Title: Test 6 - Large Test - Spread Out - Small Files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Ensure that our server can handle up to the specified 100 requests, 
so 100 potential threads, of small files. 
Each of these files only requires one pass through the scheduler.

How it works: 
100 requests will come in and they will be spaced out over a fairly 
large amount of time. However, they will only request files that
are under 8kb.

Expected Results:
