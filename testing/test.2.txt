Title: Test 2 - Missing files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Test several requests asking for missing files to ensure that they are not
scheduled. Also ensures that the program does not crash and still returns
an error message for each file.

How it works: 
5 requests will come in asking for non existant files.

Expected Results:
Each algorithm should have an output with five "file not found" errors.
