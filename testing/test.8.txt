Title: Test 8 - Large test - Spread out - Large Files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Ensure that our server can handle a large number of requests for small and large files. 
Unlike Tests 6 and 7 with the small files, some of these requests 
will require multiple passes in the scheduler for Round Robin 
or MLFB.


How it works: 
29 requests will come in will come in for all file sizes and they will be spaced
out over a fairly large amount of time.
29 was the largest number of request we could do for this test before 
the pythonscript started having problems.

Expected Results:
All results should be scheduled according to their algorithms.
There will be some variation because multiple requests may come
in at once for files of the same size.
The server should not crash.
SJF: 
	Something like
	1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 11, 14, 12, 13.....
	Since requests 1, 5 and 2, 4 and 6-9 etc. are the same length and 
	arrive at the  same time their order may vary based on who 
	connects first.
RR: 
	Something like
	1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 11, 14, 12, 13, 1, 7, 11, 1, 11, 1, ....
	Since requests 2, 4 and 6,9 etc. are the same length and 
	arrive at the  same time their order may vary based on who 
	connects first.	
	
MLFB:
	Something like
	1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 11, 14, 12, 13, 1, 7, 11, 1, 11, 1, ....
	Since requests and 2, 4 and 6, 9 etc. are the same length and 
	arrive at the  same time their order may vary based on who
