Title: Test 8 - Large test - Spread out - Large Files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Ensure that our server can handle up to the specified 100 requests, 
so 100 potential threads, of small and large files. 
Unlike Tests 6 and 7 with the small files, some of these requests 
will require multiple passes in the scheduler for Round Robin 
or MLFB.


How it works: 
100 requests will come in for all file sizes and they will be spaced
out over a fairly large amount of time.

Expected Results:
SJF: 
	
RR: 
	
	
MLFB:
