Title: Test 0 - Simultanuous requests, different files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: Test 4 simultaneous requests accessing different files.

How it works: 
4 clients connect to the server at the same time. After a brief pause

Expected Results:
SJF: 
	They should go from shortest to longest, so : 1, 2, 3, 4
RR: 
	They should go based on who arrives first, but a long file will require multiple passes.
	Since they all arrive at the same time the order sometimes varies, but text 3 is greater than 8kb
	so the order will be something like
