Title: Test 0 - Simultaneous requests, same files

Group Number: 10

Purpose: 
Test 5 simultaneous requests accessing the same file.
Since they're all accessing the same file, but only reading from it, there should not be
any conflict. The order will vary each time because the file size will be the same for each request
which means scheduling will depend on who managed to connect first.

How it works: 
5 clients connect to the server at the same time. After a brief pause 
to ensure all are connected they will each request the same file at the same time.

Expected Results:
SJF: 
	They should go from shortest to longest, so : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
RR: 
	They should go based on who arrives first, but a long file will require multiple passes.
	Since they all arrive at the same time the order varies slightly, but testtext3 and testtext4 are greater than 8kb
	so the order will be something like: 
	
MLFB:
	They should go based on who arrives first, but a long file will require multiple passes and
	be bumped to different priority queues.
	Since they all arrive at the same time the order varies slightly, but testtext3 is greater than 8kb and
	testtext4 is greater than 64 kb so the order will be something like :
